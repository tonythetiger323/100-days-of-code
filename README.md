# 100-Days-Of-Code Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2020

Today marks the first day of the holiday break for the full-stack coding bootcamp I TA for at Northwestern University and in an effort to encourage the students to continue coding, I challenged them with [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge by kicking off the first 30 days of it with Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

I recently started some self learning of TDD with React by starting a course on Udemy: [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZdQA0oddV9QR3Q=/) so I finished the section I was currently working on before completing the first activity for JavaScript30.

In addition to challenging the students, before getting the job as TA with the bootcamp, it had been over a year since I graduated from the course myself and I had falled off the coding bandwagon so I also intend to use this challenge to refresh myself on a lot of the basics and again develop a habit of coding regularly!

### Day 2: December 24, 2020
Day 2 in the books, today I completed the second day of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) which was making
a working analog clock with CSS and JavaScript which gave me a great review on the basic CSS animation options as well as setInterval with JavaScript.

Finished off my time working on my version of one of the homework assignments our students had to do, a CLI app made with Node.js that generates a README for your GitHub repo. Have it mostly done, it generates a README just have to tweak it properly so it properly generates the links and
"styling" with markdown which I hope to wrap up tomrrow. The repo for it can be found [here](https://github.com/tonythetiger323/README-generator/).
