# 100-Days-Of-Code Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2020

Today marks the first day of the holiday break for the full-stack coding bootcamp I TA for at Northwestern University and in an effort to encourage the students to continue coding, I challenged them with [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge by kicking off the first 30 days of it with Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

I recently started some self learning of TDD with React by starting a course on Udemy: [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZdQA0oddV9QR3Q=/) so I finished the section I was currently working on before completing the first activity for JavaScript30.

In addition to challenging the students, before getting the job as TA with the bootcamp, it had been over a year since I graduated from the course myself and I had falled off the coding bandwagon so I also intend to use this challenge to refresh myself on a lot of the basics and again develop a habit of coding regularly!
