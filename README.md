# 100-Days-Of-Code Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2020

Today marks the first day of the holiday break for the full-stack coding bootcamp I TA for at Northwestern University and in an effort to encourage the students to continue coding, I challenged them with [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge by kicking off the first 30 days of it with Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/).

I recently started some self learning of TDD with React by starting a course on Udemy: [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZdQA0oddV9QR3Q=/) so I finished the section I was currently working on before completing the first activity for JavaScript30.

In addition to challenging the students, before getting the job as TA with the bootcamp, it had been over a year since I graduated from the course myself and I had falled off the coding bandwagon so I also intend to use this challenge to refresh myself on a lot of the basics and again develop a habit of coding regularly!

### Day 2: December 24, 2020
Day 2 in the books, today I completed the second day of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) which was making
a working analog clock with CSS and JavaScript which gave me a great review on the basic CSS animation options as well as setInterval with JavaScript.

Finished off my time working on my version of one of the homework assignments our students had to do, a CLI app made with Node.js that generates a README for your GitHub repo. Have it mostly done, it generates a README just have to tweak it properly so it properly generates the links and
"styling" with markdown which I hope to wrap up tomorrow. The repo for it can be found [here](https://github.com/tonythetiger323/README-generator/).

### Day 3: December 26, 2020
Completed the 3rd and 4th activities from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com). Activity 3 was updating CSS variables with vanilla JavaScript and activity 4 was a review on array methods. Having been out of practice for so long the array methods were a tad rusty, especially reduce so the reviews were very helpful and I will have to remember to spend much more time practicing them in the future.

### Day 4: December 27, 2020
Today started with activity 5 from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) which included practicing CSS flex box and changing them with vanilla JavaScript. Wasn't super excited about this one as CSS and flex box are most certainly NOT my friend, but it did make me realize that they are simply skills I need more practice on so will be looking to do so in the near future, any recommendations on good sources for such are most definitely welcome! 

Finished up by completing more of Udemy course I'm also working on [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZdQA0oddV9QR3Q=/) where we moved into setting up Redux for the app were making by configuring the store, setting up reducers, including the root reducer, setting up the actions and tests for all of the above. The course actually also offers a path of making the app with React hooks instead of Redux and I'm planning on doing it both ways as while I'm very familiar with Redux, I haven't taken much time to familiarize myself with React hooks and look forward to doing so!

### Day 5: December 28, 2020
Completed activity 6 of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) which was pretty cool as did something I have never done before, make a type ahead with an AJAX call. While I have a working knowledge of RegEx was unaware of using "new RegExp()" in JS to create an expression which I found pretty cool

Finished up by completing the current section of the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZdQA0oddV9QR3Q=/) I'm still working on which gave a nice review on testing connected components, something I haven't done in a loooooooooong time!

### Day 6: December 29, 2020
Have been a little busier than normal as started moving out of my apartment today, and while I couldn't get in a full hour, wanted to make sure I got some coding in.

I did manage to complete activity 7 of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) which happened to be another one involving array methods, specifically some, every, find, findIndex, and splice. This time went ahead and challenged myself to actually work my own solutions as opposed to coding along with Wes Bos and was able to get them all on my own!
### Day 7: January 6th, 2021
Moving out of my place was more work than originally planned/intended so needed to put the challenge on pause, so am picking up right where I left off. 

Completed activity 8 of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) in which learn about the HTML canvas element and make a page where you draw on the screen with a brush that dynamically changes color and shape, which was pretty cool.

To wrap things up, the last time I was working on the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101ZdQA0oddV9QR3Q=/) on TDD with React, I still had a couple of tests failing, and had to hunt to find the errors causing so, and as always, when the answer is hard to find, its a dumb syntactical error, which I was just discussing with a student in the bootcamp I TA for the other day, lol.
